<h2>Idea and history</h2>
<p>The idea for this project came from my need to keep an online and nice-looking library online. Most of the books I read I read online so I wanted to have a database to fall back on when I want to see what books I have read or maybe have not read yet and I want to read<p>
<p>That lead me into making a local storage of books but understanding the need for other people to do the same thing lead me into learning Firebase to make loging-in available and a database for each user</p>
